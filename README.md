This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
The purpose of this app is to display the power of [langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) on a simple front end chat application using the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/) to provide a chat agent.

## Getting Started
1. Create an `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file and add your OpenAI api key to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable
2. Install packages
3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
